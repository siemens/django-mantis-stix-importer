History
-------


0.2.0 (2014-02-26)
++++++++++++++++++

* Added ability to generate identifier for top-level element
  (usually a STIX_Package) if an identifier for that element is
  missing: if a default namespace has been defined, then
  an identifier is generated by taking the MD5-hash of the
  xml file.

* Markings present in STIX_Package are read out and attached
  to all InfoObjects generated from the STIX_Package. 

  Note: Mantis does currently not interpret the XPATH expression
  that specifies the scope of the marking (which is not much
  of an issue, since it seems that the feature to restrict
  the scope of a marking is not much used at the moment).

* Timestamp present in `STIX_Header/Information_Source/Time/Produced_Time` 
  is read.

* Added a command-line argument to add a default-timestamp to the STIX import
  command.


* Bug fixes:

  * Attributes other than `id` and `idref` that contained a namespace were not
    handled correctly. The handler function `attr_with_namespace_handler`
    fixes this.
  * In `0.1.0`, the `xsi:type` attribute was not recorded, because in most cases,
    its information is used for determining the data type of elements and
    InfoObjects. But there are cases, e.g., in Markings, where this is not the
    case. For these cases, the `xsi:type` attribute is kept in the InfoObject.
  * Family revision info was not recorded; this has been fixed.
