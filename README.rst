Here is the output of ``--help`` for ``mantis_stix_import``::

The basic layout for this Django app with out-of-the-box configuration of ``setup.py`` for
easy build, submission to PyPi, etc., and Sphinx documentation tree was generated with Audrey Roy's excellent `Cookiecutter`_
and Daniel Greenfield's `cookiecutter-djangopackage`_ template.
