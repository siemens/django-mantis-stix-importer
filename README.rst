=============================
Mantis STIX Importer
=============================

**WARNING: Mantis is not maintained anymore: by now, the excellent MISP platform
(http://www.misp-project.org/)
offers all the functionality (and much more) that had been required when
MANTIS was created but could then not be found in any other tool.**



A module implementing import of STIX and CybOX XML files for the Mantis Cyber Threat Intelligence Mgmt. Framework.

Please refer to the quickstart information of MANTIS, available at http://django-mantis.readthedocs.org.

Once you are set up with MANTIS, you can use the Django ``manage.py`` to import
STIX indicators into your system as follows::

   $ python manage.py mantis_stix_import <xml-file>  <xml-file> ... [--settings=<path_to_your_django_settings_module]

Here is the output of ``--help`` for ``mantis_stix_import``::

    Usage: manage.py mantis_stix_import [options] xml-file xml-file ... (you can use wildcards)
    
    Imports stix XML files of specified paths into DINGO

      -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity=VERBOSITY

      --settings=SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g. "myproject.settings.main".

The basic layout for this Django app with out-of-the-box configuration of ``setup.py`` for
easy build, submission to PyPi, etc., and Sphinx documentation tree was generated with Audrey Roy's excellent `Cookiecutter`_
and Daniel Greenfield's `cookiecutter-djangopackage`_ template.
